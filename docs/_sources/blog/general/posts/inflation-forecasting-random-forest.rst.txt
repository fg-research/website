    <p>
    Inflation forecasts are used for informing economic decisions at various levels,
    from households to businesses and policymakers. Machine learning approaches
    offer several advantages for inflation forecasting, including the ability to
    handle large and complex datasets, capture nonlinear relationships, and adapt
    to changing economic conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
    Several recent papers have studied the problem of forecasting US inflation with
    machine learning methods using the <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/" target="_blank">FRED-MD</a>
    dataset <a href="#references">[1]</a>. The FRED-MD dataset includes over 100
    monthly time series belonging to 8 different groups of US macroeconomic indicators:
    output and income, labour market, consumption and orders, orders and inventory,
    money and credit, interest rates and exchange rates, prices, and stock market.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this post, we will focus on the random forest model introduced in <a href="#references">[2]</a>,
    which was found to outperform both standard univariate forecasting models such as the AR(1) model
    and several other machine learning methods including Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net regressions.
    We will use the random forest model for forecasting the US CPI monthly inflation, which we
    define as the month-over-month logarithmic change in the US CPI as in <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
    For simplicity, we will consider only one-month-ahead forecasts. We will train the model
    on the FRED-MD time series up to January 2023, and generate the one-month-ahead forecasts
    from February 2023 to January 2024. We find that the random forest model outperforms
    the AR(1) model by approximately 30% in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), in line
    with the results in <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
