    Time series clustering is the task of partitioning a set of time series into homogeneous groups.
    Traditional clustering algorithms based on the Euclidean distance, such as K-Means clustering,
    are not directly applicable to time series data, as time series with similar patterns can have
    large Euclidean distance due to misalignments and offsets along the time axis...

    Stock return forecasting has been extensively studied by both academic researchers and
    industry practitioners. Numerous machine learning models have been proposed for this purpose,
    ranging from simple linear regressions to complex deep learning models.
    In this post, we examine the performance of liquid neural networks (LNNs),
    a new neural network architecture for sequential data.

    Anomaly detection in electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial for early diagnosis
    and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. With the development of wearable ECG sensors,
    it has become possible to monitor a patient's heart condition continuously and in real
    time. However, it is impracticable for healthcare professional to manually review such
    a large amount of data...

    Arrhythmia classification based on electrocardiogram (ECG) data involves identifying and
    categorizing abnormal patterns of cardiac electrical activity detected in the ECG signal.
    Arrhythmia classification is important for diagnosing cardiac abnormalities, assessing the
    risk of adverse cardiovascular events and guiding appropriate treatment strategies...

    Anomaly detection in financial time series plays a crucial role in identifying unusual market conditions
    that could affect trading strategies and pose risks to investors. Anomaly detection can help identify
    abnormal price movements or trading volumes associated with specific events, such as earnings announcements,
    release of economic indicators, or geopolitical tensions...
