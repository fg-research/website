This website describes the machine learning products that fg-research makes available
to Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers as an independent software vendor (ISV) on the AWS Marketplace.
More in-depth technical documentation is available on
our `GitHub <https://github.com/fg-research>`__ page and on each individual product listing
page on the `AWS Marketplace <https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/seller-profile?id=seller-nkd47o2qbdvb2>`__.

This website includes a blog with machine learning tutorials and product demonstrations.
While we make any effort to keep the blog up to date,
the results presented in the blog might not always be reproducible due
to releases of new product versions (such as upgrades to the latest Amazon SageMaker deep learning containers)
or changes in the input data obtained from external sources (such as public APIs).

The blog includes descriptions of applications of machine learning algorithms to financial and medical data.
These do not represent financial or medical advice, and we make no warranty that these machine learning algorithms
are fit for purpose to be used as a basis for financial decisions or medical diagnoses.

In no event will fg-research be liable for any loss or damage including without limitation,
indirect or consequential loss or damage, or any loss or damage whatsoever arising
from loss of data or profits arising out of, or in connection with, the use of this website.

This website links to other websites which are not under the control of fg-research.
We have no control over the nature, content and availability of those sites.
The inclusion of any links does not necessarily imply a recommendation or endorse the views expressed within them.

Every effort is made to keep the website up and running smoothly.
However, fg-research takes no responsibility for, and will not be liable for,
the website being temporarily unavailable due to technical issues beyond our control.
