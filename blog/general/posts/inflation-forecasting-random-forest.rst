Forecasting US inflation with random forests

    <p>
    Inflation forecasts are used for informing economic decisions at various levels,
    from households to businesses and policymakers. Machine learning approaches
    offer several advantages for inflation forecasting, including the ability to
    handle large and complex datasets, capture nonlinear relationships, and adapt
    to changing economic conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
    Several recent papers have studied the problem of forecasting US inflation with
    machine learning methods using the <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/" target="_blank">FRED-MD</a>
    dataset <a href="#references">[1]</a>. The FRED-MD dataset includes over 100
    monthly time series belonging to 8 different groups of US macroeconomic indicators:
    output and income, labour market, consumption and orders, orders and inventory,
    money and credit, interest rates and exchange rates, prices, and stock market.
    For a detailed overview of the FRED-MD dataset, we refer to
    <a href=https://fg-research.com/blog/general/posts/fred-md-overview.html
    target="_blank">our previous post</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this post, we will focus on the random forest model introduced in <a href="#references">[2]</a>,
    which was found to outperform both standard univariate forecasting models such as the AR(1) model
    and several other machine learning methods including Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net regressions.
    We will use the random forest model for forecasting the US CPI monthly inflation, which we
    define as the month-over-month logarithmic change in the US CPI index as in <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
    For simplicity, we will consider only one-month-ahead forecasts. We will train the model
    on the FRED-MD time series up to January 2023, and generate the one-month-ahead forecasts
    from February 2023 to January 2024. Our findings indicate that the random forest model outperforms
    the AR(1) model by approximately 30% in terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), in line
    with the results in <a href="#references">[2]</a>.

    As discussed in <a href=https://fg-research.com/blog/general/posts/fred-md-overview.html
    target="_blank">our previous post</a>, the FRED-MD dataset is updated on a monthly basis.
    The monthly releases are referred to as <i>real-time vintages</i>. Each real-time vintage
    includes the data from January 1959 up to the previous month. For instance, the 02-2024
    vintage contains the data from January 1959 to January 2024.
    </p>

    <p>
    The real-time vintages also include a suggested transformation to be applied to each time
    series in order to ensure stationarity. The possible transformations are first order
    difference, second order difference, logarithm, first order logarithmic difference,
    second order logarithmic difference, percentage change and no transformation.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this post, we use the 02-2023 real-time vintage for model training and hyperparameter tuning,
    while we use all subsequent real-time vintage up to 02-2024 for model testing. As a first
    step, we find the best model hyperparameters by training model on the data up to January 2022
    and minimizing the RMSE on the data from February 2022 to January 2023. After that we retrain
    the model on all the data up to January 2023, and generate the one-month-ahead forecasts from
    February 2023 to January 2024 by using as inputs in the model the data in the real-time
    vintages from 03-2023 to 02-2024.
    </p>
