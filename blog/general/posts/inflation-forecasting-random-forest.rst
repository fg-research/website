Forecasting US inflation with random forests

    <p>
    Inflation forecasts are used for informing economic decisions at various levels,
    from households to businesses and policymakers. Machine learning approaches
    offer several advantages for inflation forecasting, including the ability to
    handle large and complex datasets, capture nonlinear relationships, and adapt
    to changing economic conditions.
    </p>

    <p>
    Several recent papers have studied the problem of forecasting US inflation with
    machine learning methods using the <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/mccracken/fred-databases/" target="_blank">
    FRED-MD</a> dataset <a href="#references">[1]</a>. The FRED-MD dataset includes
    over 100 monthly time series belonging to 8 different groups of US macroeconomic
    indicators: output and income, labour market, consumption and orders, orders and
    inventory, money and credit, interest rates and exchange rates, prices, and stock
    market. For a detailed overview of the FRED-MD dataset, we refer to
    <a href=https://fg-research.com/blog/general/posts/fred-md-overview.html
    target="_blank">our previous post</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In this post, we will focus on the random forest model introduced in <a href="#references">[2]</a>,
    which was found to outperform both standard univariate forecasting models such as the AR(1) model
    and several other machine learning methods including Lasso, Ridge and Elastic Net regressions.
    We will use the random forest model for forecasting the US CPI monthly inflation, which we
    define as the month-over-month logarithmic change in the US CPI index as in <a href="#references">[2]</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    For simplicity, we will consider only one-month-ahead forecasts. We will use the random
    forest model for predicting next month's inflation based on the current month's values
    of all FRED-MD indicators, including the current month's inflation. We will train the
    model on the FRED-MD time series up to January 2023, and generate the one-month-ahead
    forecasts from February 2023 to January 2024.

    <p>
    As discussed in <a href=https://fg-research.com/blog/general/posts/fred-md-overview.html
    target="_blank">our previous post</a>, the FRED-MD dataset is updated on a monthly basis.
    The monthly releases are referred to as <i>vintages</i>. Each vintage includes the data
    from January 1959 up to the previous month. For instance, the 02-2024 vintage contains
    the data from January 1959 to January 2024.
    </p>

    <p>
    The vintages are subject to retrospective adjustments, such as seasonal adjustments,
    inflation adjustments and backfilling of missing values. For this reason, different
    vintages can potentially report different values for the same time series on the
    same date. Furthermore, different vintages can include different time series, as
    indicators are occasionally added and removed from the dataset.
    </p>

    <p>
    We use 02-2023 vintage for training and hyperparameter tuning, while we use the last
    month in each vintage from 03-2023 to 02-2024 for testing. Our approach is different
    from the one used in <a href="#references">[2]</a>, where the same vintage (01-2016)
    is used for both training and testing. In our view, our approach allows us to evaluate
    the model in a more realistic scenario where on a given month we forecast next month's
    inflation using as input the data available on that month, without taking into account
    any ex-post adjustment that could be applied to the data in the future.

Code
******************************************
This section presents and explains the Python code used for the analysis.

==========================================
Set-Up
==========================================
We start by importing the dependencies.

.. code:: python

    import optuna
    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
    from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
    from sklearn.metrics import root_mean_squared_error

After that, we define a number of auxiliary functions for downloading and processing the FRED-MD dataset.
As discussed in <a href=https://fg-research.com/blog/general/posts/fred-md-overview.html target="_blank">
our previous post</a>, the FRED-MD dataset indicates a set of transformations to be applied to the time
series in order to ensure their stationarity, which are implemented in the function below.

.. code:: python

    def transform_series(x, tcode):
        '''
        Transform the time series.

        Parameters:
        ______________________________________________________________
        x: pandas.Series
            Time series.

        tcode: int.
            Transformation code.
        '''

        if tcode == 1:
            return x
        elif tcode == 2:
            return x.diff()
        elif tcode == 3:
            return x.diff().diff()
        elif tcode == 4:
            return np.log(x)
        elif tcode == 5:
            return np.log(x).diff()
        elif tcode == 6:
            return np.log(x).diff().diff()
        elif tcode == 7:
            return x.pct_change()
        else:
            raise ValueError(f"unknown `tcode` {tcode}")
